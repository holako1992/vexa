"""calendar_sync — ICS feed / Google Calendar API → planned meetings (see README.md).

Public surface: ``parse_ics`` / ``parse_google_events`` / ``sync_user`` (pure logic), the
production I/O adapters ``fetch_ics`` / ``fetch_configs`` / ``fetch_google_access_token`` /
``fetch_google_events`` (DB-30), and the shared one-user pass ``run_user_sync`` (+ stamp helpers)
used by BOTH the entrypoint's background poll loop and the user-facing sync-now edge.
